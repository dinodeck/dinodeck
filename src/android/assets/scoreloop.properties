game.name = Play On Words

# The version of your game (game version should be 1.0 or above)

# If your game supports multiple modes specify the minimum and maximum modes
# here. By default, every game has one mode. To add more modes, modify the
# game.mode.max. Note that the maximum is not inclusive, (i.e. min=0, max=3
# defines modes 0, 1, and 2).
#game.mode.min = 0
#game.mode.max = 1

# In order to sort local scores, you have to define a score ordering.
# default = result=desc;minorResult=desc;level=desc
# scores can be ordered by three columns: result, minorResult and level
# if a column is not specified it will be ignored for ordering
game.score.ordering = level=desc;result=desc;minor_result=desc

# The number of Scores that should be stored in the Local Leaderboard.
# set to 0 to disable the local leaderboard (default is 20)

# In case of network error while submitting a score, the score is saved locally and
# a SubmitScoreException is thrown.
# These scores can be resubmitted by using
# - ScoreloopCore: ScoresController.loadLocalScoresToSubmit()
# - ScoreloopUI: StandardScoreloopManager.submitLocalScores()
# The default value is false
network.offline.support.score = true

# By default, ScoreloopUI enables access to the local device address book. This

# from the AndroidManifest.xml

# If you want to use the payment feature in the ui, you have to uncomment the following (default is false).
